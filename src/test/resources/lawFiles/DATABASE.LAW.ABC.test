  õ 5. Policy of state and purpose of chapter.  It is hereby declared as
the policy of the state that it is necessary to regulate and control the
manufacture, sale and distribution within the state of alcoholic
beverages for the purpose of fostering and promoting temperance in their
consumption and respect for and obedience to law. It is hereby declared
that such policy will best be carried out by empowering the liquor
authority of the state to determine whether public convenience and
advantage will be promoted by the issuance of licenses to traffic in
alcoholic beverages, the increase or decrease in the number thereof and
the location of premises licensed thereby, subject only to the right of
judicial review hereinafter provided for. It is the purpose of this
chapter to carry out that policy in the public interest. The
restrictions, regulations and provisions contained in this chapter are
enacted by the legislature for the protection, health, welfare and
safety of the people of the state.
